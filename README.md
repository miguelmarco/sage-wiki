# sage-wiki
code for a wiki modified to be a repository of sagemath documentation

It is basically a moimnoin instance with a few additions and modifications:

- It has the sagecell plugin enabled, configured to run all the cells in a page in a single session.
- The default theme is a slightly modified moniker
- Added a couple of plugins to upload and download sage worksheets
